# Artificial Neural Network


This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files that show the theory behind a fully-connected neural networks, and an aplication using TensorFlow and Keras for autoencoders.
More simple applications will be add in the future.

## Contents

- nn_autoencoder.ipynb: This notebook demonstrates how to build a fully-connected autoencoder using TensorFlow and Keras. An autoencoder is a type of neural network that can be used for unsupervised learning tasks like feature extraction and dimensionality reduction.

- ann_theory.ipynb: This notebook provides an overview of the theory behind fully-connected neural networks. It covers topics like activation functions, backpropagation, and weight initialization.
